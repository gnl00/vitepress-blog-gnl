Even when the task at hand is to match the existence of a large value, hashing it (for example with SHA1) is a better idea, especially from the perspective of memory and bandwidth.</p></li><li><p>Very short keys are often not a good idea. 太短的 Key 不推荐</p><p>There is little point in writing &quot;u1000flw&quot; as a key if you can instead write &quot;user:1000:followers&quot;. The latter is more readable and the added space is minor compared to the space used by the key object itself and the value object.
